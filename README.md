# Hey! This is my libft
As you probably can see, this is not what i submitted for the project (that version is [here](https://github.com/luna7111/raw-libft) ;p).
I have remade, changed and added some functions so i can work on the rest of my projects more comfortably. I strongly encourage you to do the same once you submit the project.

If any of the functions here is useful for you, you can use and/or modify them so they suit your needs better but **always** try to understand the code you are using (or even better: try and make it yourself).

✨ Anyways, have a great day, hitchhiker 👍🏻 ✨
